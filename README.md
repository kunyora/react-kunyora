A flexible Rest Client for Javascript web and native applications

- **Build UI component and sync with data:** react-kunyora makes it easy to sync your UI's with your restful store by removing the complexity in writing imperative codes and replacing these codes with declarative codes without complicating data flow.

- **Build for both native Android and Ios Platforms in React-Native:** Compose your native views exposed by this libraries with data from your restful Api. Its easy and works in the same pattern as the web. Same API for every purpose

- **Manage Request Prefetch before Route Push:** You can manage the prefetch of request before route push to the next visible route to your users. In essence, react-kunyora helps you store the response of a requested route thereby reducing the need to send queries when a user gets to a visible route. 

React-Kunyora is a library which has its integrations with [Kunyora](https://github.com/kunyora/kunyora). Kunyora has come to solve a problem we noticed most software developers overlook when building softwares which is the problem of speed. However, the library is currently starting with a pre-release version , and we hope to build this functionality into the major 1.0 release. For now, Kunyora only acts as an api request handler that helps you build UI's without having to plumb your whole codebase with lots of API calls. 

See the official [Kunyora website](https://kunyora.github.io/kunyora) for an introduction to kunyora and react-kunyora and an insight on what we are currently achieving and the vision of what we hope to achieve.
